# Flicrawler

A crawler to get images from Flicker API

---

Version 0.0

This is not originated from my hand. I got this file from James Hays open source project, just as stated in file header.

I extend it, make it more readable and make it like python fashion. This project aims to be a fast and easy tool for crawling images from Flicker API.

## Usage

``` git clone https://github.com/Oh233/Flicrawler.git```
``` cd Flicrawler ```

Create an list, (i.e.```query.txt```) and type things you want to queried in this list.

``` python image_crawler --query query.txt ``` to generate a new list of descriptions.

After that, open MATLAB files and run ```download_image_int.m``` to download a series of images.
